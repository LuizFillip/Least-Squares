# Numerical Applications

## Introduction

In this repository you can find some implementations from numerical analysis. However, it is still in the development and organization phase. So, little by little I will be adding files and improving the information.

For while, you can find here:

- Interpolation by Fourier analysis;
- Adjust like cossine by least squares.
